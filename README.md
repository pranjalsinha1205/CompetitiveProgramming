1) Java is a true object oriented language having compiler and interpreter.

2) Static variables are initialized only once, these variables are called impure variables.

3) There is only 1 pure language, Simula 67

4) Interpreter takes byte code and convert it into executable code, compiler takes the code and converts it into machine language.

5) Iterative code is better in comparison to recursive code because it has lower time complexity.

6) 1 2 3 4 5 -> store in array as they are already sorted

7) 2 3 1 4 5 -> sotre in hashset  as they are not sorted
