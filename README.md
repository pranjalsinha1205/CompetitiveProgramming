1) Java is a true object oriented language having compiler and interpreter.

2) Static variables are initialized only once, these variables are called impure variables.

3) There is only 1 pure language, Simula 67

4) Interpreter takes byte code and convert it into executable code, compiler takes the code and converts it into machine language.

5) Iterative code is better in comparison to recursive code because it has lower time complexity.

6) 1 2 3 4 5 -> store in array as they are already sorted

7) 2 3 1 4 5 -> sotre in hashset  as they are not sorted

1) String is a sequence of characters, numbers, symbols all enclosed within double quotes.

2) Hashmap is a data structure with key-value pairs where the time complexity to fetch a value using a key is O(1)

3) It is there in the java.util package

4) We use it when we have to store a vvery large dataset that might need to access some particular value later. Ex- Aadhar card dataset

5) Methods in it are, put(key, value), remove(key), get(key), containsKey(key), size(), isEmpty(), clear()-> removes all the mappings in the hashmap, keySet()-> returns the set of keys

6) Call Stack has 5 threads, reference handler(it works with new, it will be the first thread), finalizer(), single dispatcher, attach listener, commmon cleaner(garbage collector)
